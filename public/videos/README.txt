To add your own video background:

1. Prepare your video:
   - Keep it short (15-30 seconds) and loop seamlessly
   - Compress it to reduce file size (aim for under 5MB)
   - Resolution of 1280x720 or 1920x1080 is recommended
   - Format: MP4 with H.264 codec

2. Upload your video:
   - Replace the real-estate-background.mp4 file in this directory
   - Make sure the filename matches what's referenced in the code

3. Test performance:
   - Check that the video loads quickly on different devices
   - Ensure it doesn't affect page load times significantly

Best practices:
- Use a video that's not too busy or distracting
- Ensure good contrast with text that will appear over it
- Consider adding a mobile-optimized version for smaller screens
